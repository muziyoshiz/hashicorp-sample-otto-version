# hashicorp-sample-otto-version

Sample configuration of HashiCorp tools, Otto version

## Overview

This is the Otto version of [muziyoshiz/hashicorp-sample](https://github.com/muziyoshiz/hashicorp-sample "muziyoshiz/hashicorp-sample").

This sample is only for trying immature Otto features. It requires some complicated manual settings more than "otto compile" and "otto dev" before running. I do not recommend using this configuration as a practicable one.

## System Requirements

The following software must be installed for deploying VMs by this configuration:

* VirtualBox
* Vagrant
* Ansible

This configuration requires more than 10 GB memory. It was tested in the following environment:

* MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)
    * CPU: 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7
    * Memory: 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3
* OS X Yosemite 10.10.5
* VirtualBox 5.0.10
* Vagrant 1.7.4
* Ansible 1.9.4
